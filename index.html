          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h2>
          <p>Firstly, there does seem to be a steady correlation between poverty rate and the percentage of the population without healthcare.
            As the poverty percent climbs, so does the number of people lacking healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>However, New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate but not the lowest rate of people without healthcare. This could perhaps be
              due to overall living conditions, averge age of the population, or something as simple as driving conditions. If younger people feel safer, 
              they may be less likely to make sure they have healthcare if it does not seem vital. 
          </p>

          <p>Also, Texas has the highest percentage of people without healthcare, yet it does not have the highest poverty rate. Socioeconomic, cultural, and geogrpahical
              differences could all contribute to this. There are many variables at play that could be contributing to a higher rate of people without healthcare.
